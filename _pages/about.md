I am a Master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University at Buffalo, with research specializing in Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Previously, I spent three years at Citi as a Tech Analyst, where I developed innovative in-house tools to streamline and optimize inter team data workflows. 

My expertise lies in designing and implementing end-to-end object detection models with integrated reasoning capabilities, also optimized for resource-constrained devices (and mobile phones), enabling more sophisticated recognition beyond pure detection. As of late, I have been working as a Research Assistant, focusing on detection with reasoning using state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to ground and count objects in high-density scenarios.

I am currently interning at **Mercedes-Benz R&D** in San Jose as a **Machine Learning Computing Intern** on the Autonomous Driving - Middleware team. My work focuses on model optimization and deployment across various hardware targets.
