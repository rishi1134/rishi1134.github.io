Work experience
======
* **Research Assistant, Feb 2025 - Present**
  * The Research Foundation for SUNY, Buffalo, NY
  * Duties included: 
    - Developed a **high-density object counting** solution using **GroundingDINO** integrated with Swin-B and BERT
 encoders.
    - Implemented a **feature fusion** module with bidirectional cross-attention across text and image modalities, enhancing
 model interaction.
    - Improved performance through **semantic-guided visual and textual prompt tuning** combined with domain-specific loss
 functions, achieving a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 1**.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Junsong Yuan, Dr. Peter CW Kim

* **Graduate Student Assistant - Grader, Jan 2025 - Present**
  * University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY
  * Duties included: Course Grader for 'CSE574 Intro Machine Learning', evaluating student quizzes and assignments
  * Supervisor: Dr. Asif Imran

* **Tech Program App Dev 2 - C10, July 2021 - July 2024**
  * Citi (CSIPL, Citigroup), Chennai, India
  * Duties included: 
    - Co-owned and led the development of a web-based end-to-end tool initiative for data creation and conditioning,
 reducing the time and effort required for data handling. Engineered the tool using ReactJS and NodeJS, optimizing
 test data creation and conditioning workflows
    - Developed API layers in .NET using minimal-API, exposing Selenium-C# automation functionalities and enabling
 remote headless execution which **decreased data creation time by 5x**, reduced cross-team dependency and **turnaround time by 80%**
    - Designed C# automation scripts for Fund Transfer module, **increasing the test coverage** for 7 market countries **by
 50%** and **saving cost** in licensing tools **by 30%**

* **Computer Vision Intern, Jan 2021 - June 2024**
  * PlaEye LLC
  * Duties included: 
    - **Logo Detection and Analysis in Images**: Created a brand analytics system and an Android application that can detect, and classify different sports brands in a given image scene captured from the app and list down the number of instances for each brand. The model was trained on **LogoDet-3k dataset** and the **inference model was run using ArmNN** for arm64-v8a architecture devices
    - Dealt with the challenging in-the-wild dataset marked by class imbalance and diverse image features, including textual and visual logos, with scaled loss functions and class augmentations

* **Computer Vision Intern, Apr 2020 - May 2020**
  * PlaEye LLC
  * Duties included: 
    - Developed a novel algorithm for **automated tennis court calibration using Homography and Cross ratios** as the primary basis to address the challenging aspect of **single-view calibration systems** where it is difficult to extract the feature points from partially occluded or poorly recorded court area images/video feeds
    - Created UI-based tools (using PyQt) for perspective projection and camera calibration
    - Contributed to optimizing the background subtraction algorithm SubSENSE for GPU using CUDA with C
    - Helped in creating a depth estimation algorithm from 2D-to-3D translation with the help of perspective projection and shadow point computation using ray geometry which was later used by the team to determine the position and spin of tennis balls from the video feed

Honors & Awards
